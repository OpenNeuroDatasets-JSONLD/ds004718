Currently, the field of neurobiology of language is based on data from only a few Indo-European languages. The majority of this data comes from younger adults neglecting other age groups. Here we present a multimodal database which consists of task-based and resting state fMRI, structural MRI, and EEG data while participants over 65 years old listened to sections of the story The Little Prince in Cantonese. We also provide data on participantsâ€™ language history, lifetime experiences, linguistic and cognitive skills. Audio and text annotations, including time-aligned speech segmentation and prosodic information, as well as word-by-word predictors such as frequency and part-of-speech tagging derived from natural language processing (NLP) tools are included in this database. Both MRI and EEG data diagnostics revealed that the data has good quality. This multimodal database could advance our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of language comprehension in the older population and help us study the effects of healthy aging on the relationship between brain and behaviour.
